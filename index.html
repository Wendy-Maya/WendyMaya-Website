        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">LanguagesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">21 year old student born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. 
        Currently studying at University of California, Riverside. 
        Attending college to get a Bachelor's Degree and help out parents. 
        After college, I do not have a plan but I would like to have a job and use my major as a start.
        
        <br><br>
        Knows English and Spanish.
        
        <br><br>
      My plan is to get some kind of job after graduating to help out with my family. 
      They have helped me out, so I want to be the one to help them.
      I do not have jobs in mind but the route that I want to go with is having a job that requires or wants people who know more than one language.
      
        <br><br>

       A person who not only studies but also loves playing video games. 
       Has been playing mostly battle royale games. Such games are Fortnite and Apex Legends.
       Also plays random games with friends such as Smite, Warframe, and a bit of Stardew Valley.
       One day, I aspire to buy or build my own computer to finally play games on the PC instead of a console.
      

        <br><br>
      One day, I would like to travel around the world and meet up with friends. 
      I would also like to explore and have more hobbies such as drawing, or making art, as well as practice on  my photography. 
      While I do not have a professional camera to help out with this hobby, I am starting out with just my phone camera and trying different angles in order to get a better picture. 
      With drawing, I did start with an artbook that I used in high school but did stop for a while. 
      One day, I would want to self teach myself with human anatomy and drawing and improve over time.

        <br><br>
      My current hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, and reading books.
       
      <br><br>  
     The books that I am currently reading are Fahrenheit 451 and Grimmâ€™s Fairy Tales. 
     
     <br><br>
     
     The books that I have read in the past and that I enjoyed are the following:
     
     <br>
     
      â€¢ Flowers for Algernon<br>
      â€¢ The Kite Runner<br>
      â€¢ A Thousand Splendid Suns<br>
      â€¢ Dear Evan Hansen: The Novel<br>
      â€¢ The Heroes of Olympus Series (In Progress)<br>
      â€¢ Percy Jackson Series (In Progress)<br>
      â€¢ Of Mice and Men<br>
      â€¢ To Kill a Mockingbird<br>
      â€¢ Ender's Game<br>

    <br>
      
      On a professional level, I am more of an active listener. 
      If there is a problem, I would first hear the person out before asking questions and try
      to have a solution.
      In other words, I am usually a critical thinker and try to problem solve whenever it is needed
      
      <br><br>
      
      I am also respectful with those around me. If you respect me, I respect you.
      Organization is something that I am at the top of. It is something that I always need to do 
      so that I can plan ahead and keep everything clean.
